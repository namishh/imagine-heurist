- Let’s explore and select an image model that resembles the style you want to create.

Personally, I often use “AAMXLAnimeMix” and “CyberRealisticXL”.
When I want realistic images, I use the CyberRealisticXL model, and for creating images in all genres, the AAMXLAnimeMix model is my preferred choice.

- As mentioned earlier, Heurist provides basic examples that make it very accessible even for beginners like myself.

(Let’s briefly understand the prompt, negative prompt, width, height, sampling steps, guidance scale, and seed that we need to write here, and move on)

1. Prompt: The text input provided by the user to initiate the image generation process. This text is used to describe the content, style, or other instructions for the desired image.
2. Neg_prompt: An optional text input describing specific elements that should not be included in the generated image. This text can be used to remove or exclude certain elements from the generated image.
3. Samping steps: The number of iterations used in the image generation process. Each iteration progressively improves and adds detail to the image. This value influences the time taken for image generation and the quality of the generated image. Typically, higher iteration counts result in higher-quality images but require more time.
4. Width: The width of the generated image, expressed as a number. It determines the width of the image.
5. Height: The height of the generated image, expressed as a number. It determines the height of the image.
6. Guidance_scale: Guidance scale is a factor that adjusts the guidance for the prompt during the image generation process. This value is represented as a real number between 0 and 1, where higher values indicate greater adherence to the prompt. In other words, higher guidance scale values result in images that more closely match the prompt. For example, when generating an image for the prompt “a cat walking in the forest,” setting a high guidance scale would increase the likelihood of generating an image that accurately depicts a cat walking in the forest.
7. Seed: The seed is the initial value used to generate random events. It is a crucial factor that determines the randomness used in the image generation process. Using the same seed will always produce the same random results, ensuring reproducibility and consistency of results in experiments. For example, when generating images multiple times with the same prompt and guidance scale, using the same seed will result in the same image each time. Conversely, using different seeds will result in slightly different images for each attempt. The seed is used to control the randomness of the results in the image generation process.
Setting the seed value to -1 assigns a completely random seed value by the system, resulting in non-deterministic results where a different random image is generated each time. This allows for exploring different random images.

When reproducibility of results is important, a specific seed value can be specified, while using -1 seed can be useful for testing and exploration purposes. The -1 seed can be effectively utilized for testing and exploration purposes

(Prompt: The Key to AI Image Generation)
AI image generation models take in text prompts to generate corresponding images. Therefore, the ability to write prompts is crucial. Writing a good prompt can yield the desired image, but an inappropriate prompt may result in unintended outcomes. For beginners, it’s advisable to initially focus on key parameters like prompt, negative prompt, sampling steps, guidance scale, width, height, and specify a seed to ensure reproducibility. As you gain experience, you can explore other advanced parameters. Refer to various image prompt websites and use “pondera” when facing difficulties to generate desired image prompts and accumulate experience by generating images through AI models.

## (Writing Prompt Tips)

- Be Specific: Providing more specific information to the model can result in images closer to what you desire. For example, “A lush pine forest landscape with a blue lake and low-hanging clouds over rocky mountains” is a better prompt than “Beautiful scenery.”

EX “Beautiful scenery” / “A lush pine forest landscape with a blue lake and low-hanging clouds over rocky mountains”

![Virtual Idol](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/0*J5OIAKdDAaj-E97f)

- Specifying Key Elements: Specify the main elements that should be included in the image to help the model better recognize them. Include terms like “Galaxies,” “alien,” “fantasy forest,” etc., in the prompt.

![Virtual Idol](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/0*FWU4vJ9NEJp7JCiX)

- Utilizing Negative Prompt: By specifying unwanted elements in the negative prompt, you can obtain images where those elements are excluded. Terms like “nude,” “logos,” “text,” etc., can be designated in the negative prompt. When these negative elements are included in the prompt, the negative prompt takes effect, and it works effectively
