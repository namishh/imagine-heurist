# 6 AI Prompt Styles to Nail using Imagine, Heurist AI

All right, you know the basics. You know how to craft prompts that generate brilliant images. But what if you wanted to generate a specific set of images using various styles? Follow through as I navigate you to some extensive Image-generation styles using [Imagine](https://imagine.heurist.ai/), Heurist’s AI prompt-based Image generation platform that could enhance your creativity to the next level.

## PROMPT STRUCTURE

First, we will look at how to break down your prompts. To generate beautiful and detailed images using Imagine, we need to determine the many elements to be considered for Imagine to generate our desired image.

Each prompt requires you to give a specific list of instructions that determine the final image. These include, but are not limited to **Style, Subject, Setting (Environment), Lighting conditions, etc.**

## PROMPT STYLES

1. HOLOGRAPHIC/ HOLOGRAM IMAGES

The style of ethereal holographic metallic images is a mix of some of the magical elements like dynamic patterns, shimmery surfaces, vivid and iridescent colors, layers that are translucent, and elements that bend and reflect light. These are wonderful to evoke wonder, awe, and excitement in an audience.

**Some of the prompts I used to generate images like these:**

`chromatic aberration, holographic images, hologram, foil lighting, translucent, ethereal, metal, polished, reflection, refraction, portrait of a woman, flat background, depth of field, chromatic.`

**Negative Prompts include**

`low quality, low resolution, NSFW, bad anatomy, bad face, bad eyes, deformation, and worst quality. See the results below!`

2. DOUBLE EXPOSURE, PHOTO MANIPULATION

In the world of digital photography, double exposure can be created using software by blending multiple images. Double exposure is often employed in fine art photography and portraits, Some of the important elements to consider in these styles are:

Story and concept, experimentation, the contrast of the two images, etc

**Some of the prompts to generate images like these:**

`Create a double exposure photo of an astronaut, helmet photo manipulated with galaxy, portrait, milky Way, depth of field, 35mm, ultra-detailed`

`Create a double exposure photo of a woman with flowers growing on her head, symbolism, surreal, portrait, realistic, photography, blending`

3. SURREALISM

As a design student, my teacher always used to say ‘Steal your inspiration.’ When you steal from different sources, you come up with something original. Do it like the artists did back in the day. Think like Rene Magritte, Salvador Dali, and Earnst Haas

Surrealism in art is like a wacky dream on paper. Artists paint or draw things that don’t usually go together, like a fish with human legs or a clock melting like cheese. I used different types of elements and created these images by using symbolic imagery, mixing landscapes, and distorted perspectives.

**Some of the prompts to generate images like these:**

`In the style of Rene Magritte, melting clocks, surreal landscape, create surreal digital art, otter in a coastal area, realistic, flying eyes, a UFO object.`

`Create a surrealistic painting of a gigantic otter in the style of Rene Magritte, realistic, photorealistic, 8k, hyper-maximalist`

4. PSYCHEDELIC ART

Psychedelic Art includes vibrant colors, intricate patterns, surreal imagery, and a sense of optical illusion or distortion. It tells us more about the alternative reality as if you were high on drugs. This can include effect patterns, warping, or morphing shapes that play tricks on the viewer’s eyes.

**Some of the prompts to generate images like these:**

`Create a psychedelic art portrait of a woman with detailed swirly patterns, intricate flowy colors, 8k, photography, ultra-detailed, mystical, abstract`

4. ARCHITECTURE

When generating images using Imagine for architectural photography, I think of specific elements like composition, style of the architecture (minimal or detailed), perspective, atmosphere and mood, background details and texture, the place you want the setting at (e.g Rome, Paris etc)

**Some of the prompts to generate images like these:**

`minimalist Scandinavian building, space, and extraterrestrial architecture photography, white, grey, beige, 8k, photography, realistic`

`minimalist Scandinavian building, space, and extraterrestrial architecture photography, white, grey, beige, 8k, photography, realistic`

6. PAPER TEXTURE CRAFT STYLE

Use this prompt to generate paper cut-out style images giving it a layering 3d style. This works Great for landscape imagery. The style is an inspiration from back in the day when artists used to cut out papers to combine elements like sceneries, objects, and humans to form a beautiful image to create a sense of illusion and depth of field. I specifically love this because it is really a mix of old and new design formats that give out a 3d effect on a 2d Screen.

`Create a paper craft illustration of a transformer in the city, paper cut, layers, 3D, stylized, vibrant colors.`

## CONCLUSION

No matter what style you pick, it’s essential to have a slight picture in your mind as to what result Imagine would generate. I would suggest going through these styles and coming up with your style after it.

As a design student, this article was written through years of research. experience and trial and error as well as going through each Model extensively to generate these images.

I hope you got some inspiration from these styles. Time to generate yours through Imagine.

P.S The new Architecture SD model slaps!
