Art has always been a reflection of human creativity, imagination, and expression. The introduction of Heurist paved the way to free access of AI tools like the “Imagine app” that can be used to express digital art in many forms. Although, through the endless prompts and generation of images, each art is unique and falls under a specific type of style giving it a unique identity.

This article seeks to further explain the popular styles of art associated with AI image generations and aims to aid newbies on their image generation journeys by showing them the basis on which AI arts are generated.

## Popular Styles Of Art Associated With AI Image Generation.

1. SURREALISM

This is a style of art that is mainly defined by the displaying of the unconscious mind. Surrealism is mainly defined by these key characteristics:

- Dream-like and undescribable scenes
- Distorted figures and shapes
- Bizarre composition of ordinary objects
- Spontaneity and illogical scenes

Knowing popular Surreal artists will also aid in your generations as you can input their names into your prompts giving the AI a clear depiction of the style of art you seek to generate. Some popular Surreal artists include:- Salvador Dali, Reñe Magritte e.t.c.

The images below were generated using the IMAGINE APP by Heurist and they represent the surrealism category of art.

2. ABSTRACT ART

Abstract art is a style of art that does not attempt to represent an accurate depiction of a visual reality. Instead, it emphasizes shapes, colors, forms, line, value and texture to convey ideas and emotions in a non-representational way.

Popular abstract artists include Vasily Kandinsky, Jackson Pollock e.t.c. Remember that the names of these artists can always be included in your prompt to make it more precise.

3. REALISM

This style of art aims to depict subjects as they appear in real life, often emphasizing detail and accuracy. It portrays everyday scenes like ordinary people and familiar objects. The key characteristics of Realism art include 

- Accurate representation
- Observation and detailing

The images generated below represent this style of art.

4. PHOTOREALISM

This style of art is defined by the replication of reality with meticulous accuracy, often to the point where the artwork appears indistinguishable from a high-resolution photograph.

The focus is on capturing every minute detail and texture of the subject matter with accuracy, creating a sense of hyper-realism that can be both inspiring and unbelievable.

I’ve personally created photo realistic images like the ones below using Heurist and viewers on Twitter assumed they were real photographs, that’s the power of AI in your grasp.

5. FANTASY ARTS (my favorite style of art)

Fantasy art is characterized by a broad range of artistic styles and subjects that are inspired by imagination, folklore, mythology, and speculative fiction. It often features fantastical creatures, mythical beings, imaginary landscapes, and magical elements.

Fantasy art can be found in various mediums such as paintings, illustrations, sculptures, digital art, and even literature and film. Fantasy arts explore themes of heroism, adventure, mysticism, and the supernatural.

6. JAPANESE ANIME/MANGA ART

This is obviously one of the most loved styles of art today. This is the style of art used for anime cartoons and mangas. They are characterized by exaggerated facial expressions, action sequences, and intricate detailing.

Popular examples of this type of art include characters and scenes from popular animes like “Naruto, Attack on Titans, Dragon Balls".

Like all anime characters, check out these sick images below, there is truly nothing you can’t imagine with Heurist

The list goes on and on, but these are the most popular styles associated with AI image generation.

Every Image generated is fuel by an origin - which is the art style and together with a well detailed prompt, it brings your imagination to life. I’m certain every newbie here after reading this would understand when perhaps a zealy task comes up that requests a “photo-realistic art” for submission.
