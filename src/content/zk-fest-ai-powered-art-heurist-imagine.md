# Heurist x ZK Fest Presents: Where Blockchain Meets Imagination

Heurist is proud to announce our participation in the [ZK Fest](https://zkfest.co/) Elastic Chain Stage, a two-week celebration from September 2nd to 13th showcasing the vibrant ZKsync ecosystem. We are introducing an innovative AI-powered art festival that blends blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and community engagement.

Get ready to unleash your creativity at the intersection of AI and blockchain!

## üñåÔ∏èIntroduction

The campaign runs from September 2nd to 13th, 2024. Participants are invited to create AI art with Heurist Imagine and mint the creation as zkImagine NFT, an infinite-supply NFT collection serving as the backbone of on-chain AIGC contents.

[Heurist Imagine](https://imagine.heurist.ai/) is our flagship AI image generator, a gateway to infinite creative possibilities on-chain. Users of Imagine have free access to fine-tuned Stable Diffusion models powered by community-owned GPUs in the Heurist network, transforming text descriptions into stunning visual art. Heurist Imagine can create everything from surreal dreamscapes to hyper-realistic portraits.

## üéüÔ∏èZyfi: Your Free Pass to AIGC NFTs

Heurist is partnering with [Zyfi](https://www.zyfi.org/) to provide free mint experience for zkImagine NFT. Zyfi is the leading paymaster-as-a-service on ZKsync, supporting any token as gas or any type of custom sponsorship logic. Zyfi processes around half of all paymaster transactions on ZKsync and has been working with numerous projects and ZKchains throughout the ecosystem.

## üèÜ Triple the Creativity, Triple the Reward

The campaign unfolds in two sprints.

- **Sprint 1:** September 2nd ~ September 7th.
- **Sprint 2:** September 8th ~ September 13th.

Reward pools are distributed at the end of each sprint. After the campaign ends on September 13th, the Heurist team will collect submissions on X (Twitter) and put up a Snapshot vote for People‚Äôs Choice awards.

There are three types of rewards.

1. **The Minter‚Äôs Bounty (Pool 1):** Earn rewards for every NFT you mint.

Every participant earns a share of the dynamic Pool 1 rewards. Your share rewards depends on the number of NFTs you mint and the total amount of ETH spent on minting.

2. **The Engagement Challenge (Pool 2):** Climb the leaderboard by minting, sharing, and engaging.

For each NFT minted, your score increments by 1. After minting a NFT, you will gain additional scores for sharing your AI artwork on X (Twitter) and uploading the image to [Gateway Network.](https://mygateway.xyz/) Top 30 users on the score leaderboard will share the ZK tokens in a big Pool 2.

Create your referral link from the campaign page, and refer your friends. Each referred mint will increment the scores of both the referrer and the referee by 1.
